# Features

If you're looking to create a "simple" VPN server using the Rust programming language, it's important to understand that a full-featured, production-ready VPN is a complex piece of software involving intricate networking, security, and concurrency.

However, for a **simple, educational, or proof-of-concept VPN server in Rust**, here are the core features you should aim to implement:

### 1. TUN/TAP Device Interaction üåê
This is the most fundamental aspect of a VPN. You'll need to create and interact with a virtual network interface:
* **TUN Device Creation:** The server needs to create a TUN (Tunnel) device. This virtual interface acts like a network adapter, but instead of sending packets to a physical cable, it sends them to your program.
* **Packet Reading/Writing:** Your Rust application will read IP packets directly from this TUN device and write packets back to it.

---

### 2. Basic Network Communication (UDP) üì®
Most VPNs use UDP for performance. Your server will need:
* **UDP Socket Listener:** The server listens on a specific UDP port for incoming encrypted VPN traffic from clients.
* **Packet Forwarding:** Once a packet is read from the TUN device, it needs to be encapsulated, encrypted, and sent over the UDP socket to the client. Conversely, encrypted packets received on the UDP socket must be decrypted, decapsulated, and written to the TUN device.

### 3. Symmetric Encryption (e.g., AES-256-GCM) üîí
For simplicity in a learning project, you can start with symmetric encryption. This means both the server and the client share the same secret key.
* **Encryption/Decryption:** Implement AES-256-GCM for encrypting outgoing packets and decrypting incoming packets. This ensures the data traversing the public internet is unreadable.
* **Pre-shared Key (PSK):** For simplicity, use a hardcoded or configured pre-shared key for encryption. In a real-world VPN, key exchange is a much more complex process (e.g., Diffie-Hellman).

---

### 4. Basic Client Handling (Single Client or Fixed IPs) üë§
For a truly simple server, avoid dynamic IP allocation (like DHCP) and complex client authentication initially.
* **Static IP Assignment:** Assign a fixed IP address within your chosen VPN subnet (e.g., `10.0.0.1` for the server, `10.0.0.2` for the first client).
* **Client Identification (via PSK):** Since you're using a PSK, the client is implicitly "authenticated" by its ability to decrypt traffic. For a slightly more robust "simple" version, you might identify clients by their public IP address if it's static.

---

### 5. Routing Configuration üõ£Ô∏è
Your server needs to tell the operating system how to route traffic through the VPN.
* **IP Forwarding:** Enable IP forwarding on the server's operating system so it can pass traffic between the virtual VPN network and the public internet.
* **Route Setup:** Add routes on both the server and client machines. The client needs to send traffic destined for the internet through the VPN tunnel, and the server needs to know how to reach the client's VPN IP.

---

### 6. Command-Line Configuration / Basic Config File ‚öôÔ∏è
Make it easy to start and configure your server.
* **Arguments:** Allow specifying the listening port, the pre-shared key, and the TUN device name via command-line arguments.
* **Simple File:** A basic `.toml` or `.env` file for configuration variables is also a good option.

---

### 7. Error Handling and Logging ü™µ
Essential for debugging and understanding what your server is doing.
* **Basic Error Handling:** Use Rust's `Result` type and `unwrap_or_else`/`?` operator for robust error propagation and handling.
* **Console Logging:** Print messages to the console for important events: server start, client connection, packet encryption/decryption, and any errors.

By focusing on these features, you can build a functional, albeit basic, VPN server in Rust. This will provide a strong foundation for understanding the core concepts before diving into more advanced topics like public-key cryptography (e.g., Noise Protocol, used by WireGuard), dynamic IP allocation, firewall rules, and robust concurrency for multiple clients.
